 <br/>

##### Actually, when my friend told me this idea, I wasn't really sure how I would pull it off. Well, four days later, I pulled it off.

<br/>

##### It's got

- ##### any figures you need to know about any country, in realtime

- ##### total data for all cases in the world

- ##### local and international news updates, realtime too,

- ##### a wordcloud to show the most used words relating to coronavirus

- ##### you can also ask any questions relating to coronavirus and get answers immediately. Cool right?

##### Don't forget to check it out.
