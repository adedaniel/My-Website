> ## A personal project for my Uncle. Building blocks to web development

 <br/>

##### While I was interning at Rhics Tech, I thought about making a website to promote my uncle's Civil Engineering company. This project was fun because, even though my uncle never really used it (he wasn't really interested in paying for a domain), I got to learn a lot of things that would later advance my skills in front-end development and that's why I put it here
