### Kochbase is a platform for thought leaders, coaches, and subject matter experts to create, manage and monetize digital coaching experiences.

<br/>

- ##### Took advantage of Next.js’ “getServerSideProps” to fetch coaches' products’ details from the server side. This enabled dynamic SEOs for every coach’s products and in turn allowed search engine crawlers to easily find products from the app.

* ##### The use of Next.js enabled fast load times for pages on the app

- ##### Payment processing is done by Paystack

- ##### Built with React, NextJS. The website was styled using Chakra UI while the app used Tailwind CSS
